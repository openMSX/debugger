openMSX debugger
----------------

The openMSX debugger is a separate program that interfaces with
openMSX and controls its debugger from within a graphical user
interface.

* Requirements

The debugger requires the Qt5 GUI library to be installed.
If you are installing from binary packages, make sure you install the
development package (name ending with "-dev" or "-devel") as well.
For Mac OS X use "brew install qt5" to install the library.

A (reasonably) new version of openMSX.

* Building

Build with:

make

* Installing

Install derived/bin/openmsx-debugger manually in any place you want.
